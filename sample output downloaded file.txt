The two code snippets implement linear search and binary search respectively.  Let's analyze their time and space complexity:

**Linear Search:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, the algorithm iterates through all `n` elements of the array.  The best case is O(1) if the element is found at the beginning.  Average case is also O(n).
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.  It's iterative, not recursive.


**Binary Search:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(log n) - Binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half.  This makes it significantly faster than linear search for large arrays.  The time complexity is logarithmic because the number of comparisons needed grows proportionally to the logarithm of the input size.
* **Space Complexity:** O(log n) -  This is due to the recursive calls.  In the worst case, the recursion depth can be proportional to logâ‚‚(n).  An iterative implementation would reduce this to O(1).


**Which is better?**

Binary search is significantly better than linear search in terms of *time complexity* for sorted arrays.  Its logarithmic time complexity means it scales much better with increasing input size. Linear search is only preferable for unsorted data or very small arrays where the overhead of sorting would outweigh the benefits of binary search.


**Improvements:**

**Linear Search:**  No significant improvements are needed unless you have specific knowledge about the distribution of elements in the array (e.g., if you know the element is more likely to be found in the first half).

**Binary Search:**

1. **Iterative Implementation:** The recursive implementation can lead to stack overflow errors for very large arrays. An iterative version is generally preferred for its improved space complexity (O(1)).

   ```c
   int binarySearchIterative(int arr[], int n, int x) {
       int left = 0;
       int right = n - 1;
       while (left <= right) {
           int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Avoid overflow
           if (arr[mid] == x) return mid;
           else if (arr[mid] < x) left = mid + 1;
           else right = mid - 1;
       }
       return -1;
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling:**  Neither function explicitly handles the case where the input array is `NULL`.  Adding a check for this would make them more robust.


**In summary:**  For sorted arrays, the iterative version of binary search is vastly superior to linear search in terms of time complexity and is generally preferred for its efficiency and avoidance of potential stack overflow issues.  However, linear search is a simpler algorithm and suitable for unsorted data or small arrays.
